                      <p>I'm a 28-year-old data analyst. I like programming, plants and make difficult cakes, but 
                          I don't have too much time for freetime activities nowadays. It's a sentence to 
                          make this paragraph longer. The weather was nice today. And finally, we reached line number 2!

                    <p>
                        It is an idealized or physical device implementing 
                        a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on 
                        one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
                    </p>
                    <h3>ASCII</h3>
                    <p>
                        It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
                        Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical 
                        representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.    
                    </p>
                    <h3>RAM</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program 
                        instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. 
                        Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of 
                        the physical location of data inside the memory.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Programming language</h3>
                    <p>
                        A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce 
                        various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer 
                        and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>DNS server</h3>
                    <p>
                        A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other 
                        resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various
